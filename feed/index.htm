										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/konmari/">KonMari Method®</a>, the second category we tackle is books, and with my clients, I see a lot of variety with this category. I really enjoy helping people declutter books because I personally love books so much! </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wait-didn-t-marie-kondo-say-you-can-only-keep-30-books">Wait, didn&#8217;t Marie Kondo say you can only keep 30 books?</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s get this one out of the way first &#8211; <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/1/17/18185657/tidying-up-marie-kondo-netflix-books" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no, Marie Kondo never said this</a>. She even <a href="https://youtu.be/-3VCoY27fFI?t=200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Jimmy Kimmel</a> that she&#8217;s not sure where that rumor came from.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many people I&#8217;ve met that have completely dismissed Marie Kondo based on this ridiculous (and inaccurate) meme. As with the ENTIRE KonMari Method, there is no magic number of items to keep in any category &#8211; keep what sparks joy for you. Marie&#8217;s personal library might be around 30 books; mine is closer to 1,300. And I have full confidence that Marie would support the size of my library because I have carefully curated my books (and regularly review them); I have intentionally kept each book with <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/ideal-lifestyle/">my vision in mind</a>.</p>



<p>Phew! Now that we&#8217;re past that, let&#8217;s get down to the actual task and declutter books.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-can-t-i-declutter-books-on-the-bookshelf">Why can&#8217;t I declutter books on the bookshelf? </h3>



<p>To start you&#8217;ll want to get all of your books off the shelf so that you can sort them into sub-categories. Yes, take them off the shelves. They&#8217;re already sorted into sub-categories on the shelf? Great, that will make sorting them into sub-categories off the shelf go faster.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to physically take the books off the shelves (and out of the boxes, etc.) because moving your books around allows you to clearly see and connect with each volume. I get it &#8211; books can be heavy, they can be dusty, it sounds like a mess. But trust the process. Time and again my clients have expressed how much easier it was to make intentional decisions when their books are off the shelf for sorting.</p>



<p>Not only will the decluttering process benefit from taking your books off the shelves, but your organizing and storage efforts will be more informed as well. You&#8217;ll be able to move books around to where they work best for you, and you&#8217;ll have a much clearer idea on how much space you can dedicate to books. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-i-know-what-sparks-joy-when-i-declutter-books">How do I know what sparks joy when I declutter books? </h3>



<p>Determining what sparks joy for you is a unique, personal decision. However, there are a few common themes I see people considering when they declutter books:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ability to Display/Store Books:</strong> If you have limited space, you may need to be more discerning in your decluttering. Or you may have plenty of space to store books, but they&#8217;re not your biggest priority and you&#8217;d rather save that precious shelf space for other items.</li>



<li><strong>Read vs. Unread Books:</strong> Lots of people have assumptions about keeping books based on if they&#8217;ve been read or not. Sometimes read status can be a consideration when decluttering, but there aren&#8217;t hard rules about that. You can keep a read book, even if you&#8217;re not planning on re-reading it. You can keep unread books. You can declutter a book that you were excited to read, but now it doesn&#8217;t sound interesting anymore. Which books support your vision for your life? Keep those!</li>



<li><strong>The &#8220;Should&#8221; Books:</strong> You know these books. You should have Shakespeare on your shelves. You should read these influential business books. You should own a dictionary, doesn&#8217;t everyone have a dictionary? To these I always say &#8211; remember your vision. If the book fits into your vision, if it sparks joy, then keep it. And let the rest go. Don&#8217;t hold onto these ideas of what &#8220;should&#8221; be on your bookshelves.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-storage-and-inventory-tips-from-my-personal-library">Storage and inventory tips from my personal library</h3>



<p>Now that you&#8217;ve decluttered your books, how should you shelve them? Some people are really into the whole &#8220;shelving books by color&#8221; look. It&#8217;s a neat look from an interior design perspective, but how practical is it? If you want to be able to find your books easily, this is probably not the method for you (but if that&#8217;s not a priority, then rainbow away!).</p>



<p>Common ways to group books are by sub-category (novels, cookbooks, biographies &amp; memoirs, etc.) or alphabetically by author or title. How do YOU think about your books? That&#8217;s how you should store them. Personally, I have a lot of books, so I want mine by subject matter and alphabetical by author within those sub-categories. That&#8217;s how the Library of Congress Call Number system works, so that&#8217;s how my books are organized.</p>



<p>If you have a lot of books like me, it may be helpful to keep an inventory. Not only does this make it easier to know what you have on your shelves (ever bought a book you already own?), but it also makes it a lot easier to use a system like call number for organizing. There are a variety of inventory tools and apps you can use. I&#8217;ve been using LibraryThing since 2008 and recommend it to anyone who finds joy in keeping a larger collection of books. For the curious, you can check out <a href="https://www.librarything.com/profile/tidybookshelf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my personal library on LibraryThing</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/konmari/">KonMari Method®</a> has a specific order in which we declutter our items; the first category is always clothing. This isn&#8217;t an arbitrary starting point &#8211; there are actually very good reasons why we tackle this category first!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-we-start-with-clothing">Why do we start with clothing? </h3>



<p>The somewhat glib answer is because clothing tends to be an easy category to start with. However, there&#8217;s a lot more to that statement than is obvious on the surface! We have a very intimate relationship with our clothing. It&#8217;s something that we are physically in contact with, so we have a visceral response to whether we like our clothing or not. We sense how it feels, how it fits, how it moves. Do I like this color? Do I like this style? Do I find it easy to launder? </p>



<p>All of this information comes to us almost immediately when we pick up a piece of clothing. We&#8217;ve got a lot of data to help us understand whether or not each clothing item sparks joy! And not only does this help us to sort our clothing &#8211; it also sets us up for success for the rest of our items too. By learning how to determine what sparks joy with an easier category, we&#8217;re practicing that discernment skill. This will allow us to approach future categories with more skill and intention.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;I wear it&#8221; and &#8220;it sparks joy&#8221;?</h3>



<p>Almost all of my clients immediately default into sorting their clothing into a few different sub-categories &#8211; things they wear a lot, things they don&#8217;t wear a lot, and things that they&#8217;re holding onto that don&#8217;t fit (no, it&#8217;s not just you, almost <em>all </em>of my clients have some version of this pile). But just because you regularly wear something doesn&#8217;t mean it sparks joy! Sometimes our best pieces are lost in a cluttered closet. Or we have so many clothes that we just grab what we can find, even if it&#8217;s not our favorite. By truly evaluating each piece we are able to intentionally decide if it sparks joy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A peek inside my closet!</h3>



<p>Everyone&#8217;s clothing is different, just like everyone&#8217;s physical space is different, so no two closets are ever going to be the same. That said, my clients often ask me about <em>my</em> closet, so here are a few of my favorite tips:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Color Coordination</strong>: It&#8217;s the trick that started me on my personal organizing journey &#8211; hanging my clothes in rainbow order, something I started doing in elementary school. For me, I immediately have a sense of order in my closet because the colors aren&#8217;t all jumbled together. I&#8217;m already less focused on clutter, and more focused on what clothing will best support my day.</li>



<li><strong>Purses &amp; Bags</strong>: I used to store my purses in a big clear bin. It was neat and tidy, but a pain to pull out what I needed and wasn&#8217;t very attractive. I made some small adjustments using an inexpensive fabric bin and some acrylic bag hangers. Now I smile every time I enter my closet and see my purses on display!</li>



<li><strong>Make it Personal</strong>: I&#8217;m very fortunate that my closet has a lot of extra space, so I&#8217;ve been able to add some fun non-clothing items as a little display that sparks joy for me. But even if you don&#8217;t have much space, you can still dress up this utilitarian space. Display a sentimental item, a colorful rug, or even just a mirror with a little personality!</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When you begin your tidying festival, it&#8217;s important to decide what you want to do about donating and recycling the items that no longer spark joy. I&#8217;ve seen it countless times with my clients &#8211; they get so bogged down deciding what is the right thing to do with items that don&#8217;t spark joy that they get side-tracked from sorting the things that DO spark joy!</p>



<p><h3>I don’t want to be wasteful!</h3>A top critique that Certified KonMari Consultants hear about the KonMari Method<span class="aCOpRe">®</span> is that Marie Kondo encourages us to be wasteful and throw away all our things so that we have room . . . to buy more things. This is so completely inaccurate! We&#8217;re not focusing on what we&#8217;re getting rid of, we’re focusing on what is bringing us joy. By orienting the process around the things you will keep, you are changing your own relationship with “stuff,” an extremely important part of the process. Moving forward, you won’t want to bring things into your home that don’t spark joy. The KonMari Method is not about creating space to &#8220;buy more stuff,&#8221; let’s just go ahead and get that notion out of our heads!</p>



<p><h3>Discarding feels wasteful. What about donating and recycling?</h3>Just as the phrase <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/the-power-of-your-ideal-vision/">“spark joy” is placeholder language</a> for whatever it is that will fulfill your vision for your life, “discard” is the term we use for anything that is leaving your house. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s leaving in a trash can &#8211; there are LOTS of ways to discard things in a respectful way, both to the item as well as to the planet, through donating and recycling. Some of the questions I like to bring up when we discard things include:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-yours-to-discard">Is it yours to discard?</h4>



<p>Before discarding an item, you must determine if it is yours to sort in the first place. A common challenge is to say &#8220;well, my things are not that disorganized &#8211; it&#8217;s really my partner/children/etc. who need to declutter.&#8221; It is not our place to make decisions for items that do not belong to us &#8211; it is up to the owner of that item to determine if it is time to discard that item. Just because the assortment of rocks and sticks on your child&#8217;s dresser seems like trash to you doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t meaningful to your child. Allow others to have the opportunity to learn what sparks joy for them, and demonstrate how to make discarding decisions with your own items.</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-could-this-spark-joy-for-someone-else">Could this spark joy for someone else?</h4>



<p>Often, the items that no longer spark joy for us may still have life left in them – gently used clothing, furniture, books, etc. Consider donating these items to a nonprofit equipped to handle these donations. Some locations, such as local charity thrift stores, may be able to take many different kinds of items. Others, such as a local furniture bank or library, may only take specific items. If you are in the Atlanta area, I have compiled <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/resources/">a list of organizations</a> who accept donations of various kinds in our area.</p>



<p>A note of caution: it can be very tempting to say something along the lines of “I don’t want this any more, maybe my sister will want it.” This is a dangerous line of thinking! When faced with this scenario, Marie Kondo realized that “I was simply <em>transferring my guilt</em> at not being able to discard [items] onto [my sister].”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Only “gift” your discards when you know it’s something that person has been wanting!</p>
</div></div>
</blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-has-this-item-reached-the-end-of-its-life">Has this item reached the end of its life?</h4>



<p>When an item has truly lived out its full potential, what is the most environmentally-conscious way to dispose of it? Proper disposal sparks a lot of joy for me personally, and I have an entire rack dedicated to sorting my discards in my garage! Certain drug stores can dispose of expired medications, UPS Stores can reuse packing materials, and my favorite local resource is the <a href="https://livethrive.org/charm/items-we-accept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Hard to Recycle Materials (CHaRM)</a> – they are able to process so many different items to be reused, repurposed or recycled. For more recycling resources, both in Atlanta and nationwide, check out my <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/resources/">list of resources</a>. If you know of an awesome resource that is missing from my list, please <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact me</a> and let me know.</p>

<p>Organizing according to the <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/konmari/">KonMari Method®</a> always begins by defining your ideal vision. Many people are tempted to skip this step (they&#8217;re excited to start pulling clothes out of the closet), but that would be a grave mistake. Your ideal vision is crucial to understanding how the things you own fit into your life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-spark-joy-mean-to-you">What does &#8220;spark joy&#8221; mean to you?</h3>



<p>My first session with a new client always starts with a conversation. We&#8217;ve all heard the phrase &#8220;<a href="https://amzn.to/2DWZzEv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spark joy</a>,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not a one size fits all concept. This phrase is shorthand for something that fits into your ideal vision. It does not mean that you get super joyful with every item you own (we all have toothbrushes and bills that we need to keep). And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to start the process defining what &#8220;spark joy&#8221; means to you.</p>



<p>When I talk with clients, the conversation almost always starts with what they&#8217;re looking for in their home. But that&#8217;s not where we stop. I want to know what you feel is holding you back, not just in your physical space, but in your life. Sometimes there are things that are challenging us that influence our spaces and the things we own, but we haven&#8217;t connected the dots yet to determine that. The KonMari Method<b>®</b> is a process that helps us identify and live out our ideal lifestyle &#8211; that has to start out with a clear idea of our vision.</p>



<p>This initial conversation is one of my favorite parts of working with clients! <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/ideal-lifestyle/">Check out some of the resources</a> that you can use to help you identify your ideal vision for your life.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sometimes-your-ideal-vision-will-change">Sometimes your ideal vision will change!</h3>



<p>I love seeing how my clients&#8217; visions become crystal clear throughout the tidying process. People who were uncertain in the beginning start to focus. People who thought they had a clear idea of their vision see that the things they own don&#8217;t support that, so either the items go or the vision changes (or, in many cases, both). And some people are able to confidently state that their vision from the beginning was exactly right, and they are thrilled to have a home and items that support that vision.</p>



<p>This is why it is SO important to start with exploring your ideal vision! Your ideal vision serves as the metric by which you can evaluate the things in your life. When I ask my client &#8220;does this spark joy?&#8221; what I am asking is if the item fits into the life they have said they want for themselves. This is not only helpful as you are going through the actual tidying process, but it serves as a jumping-off point for your life post-tidying as well. Clients have started new hobbies, developed different relationships, changed jobs &#8211; all because they have so clearly defined what they&#8217;re looking for in their lives!</p>

<p>My journey to becoming one of Marie Kondo&#8217;s KonMari Consultants started at a very young age. My first organizing memory is from when I was a small child, maybe 6 or 7, growing up in rural south Georgia. I’d read in a book that the protagonist had color-coded their closet, and I’d JUST learned about Roy G. Biv in school. Needless to say, it was a messy endeavor as I was only just barely tall enough to reach my hangers, but kudos to my mom for letting me embrace my inner organizer!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amateur-hour">Amateur Hour</h3>



<p>Decades later, my clothing was still in rainbow order and I’d graduated to sorting my bookshelves according to Library of Congress Call Number. It was 2014, and Marie Kondo&#8217;s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2T4GOAP" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a></em> had just been published in the United States. A close friend who knew I was a pretty organized person asked me to help her organize her closet. She&#8217;d read Marie&#8217;s book, and was determined to get tidy. I read a couple of articles online, realized that I naturally organized in a way that was fairly consistent with Marie&#8217;s method, and decided to wing it.</p>



<p>Fast forward a few years and I was beginning to run out of friends who would let me organize their homes in exchange for free pizza and wine. I&#8217;d recently discovered the world of &#8220;clean with me&#8221; videos on YouTube, and I&#8217;d stumbled down a rabbit hole of someone who was filming their entire KonMari process. Towards the end of her tidying marathon, she mentioned that she was planning to attend one of the first KonMari Consultant Certification seminars.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-certification">Certification</h3>



<p><strong><em>Insert record scratch here.</em></strong></p>



<p>Certified KonMari Consultants? Now THAT sounded right up my alley. I&#8217;d toyed with the idea of pursing professional organizing as a side job, and to study with Marie sounded like a dream come true. I started researching all things KonMari and signed myself up for the next seminar.</p>



<p>The first step towards becoming a Certified KonMari Consultant is to complete your own tidying marathon. Now, as someone who has always been pretty organized and who doesn&#8217;t like a lot of clutter, my house was already pretty neat and tidy. But what I didn&#8217;t realize is that I had done a really good job of organizing things that no longer sparked joy. I was quite surprised when I wound up donating three FULL carloads of things that were ready for a new home.</p>



<p>I knew how to tidy my home on my own before, but it took the KonMari Method<b>®</b> to shift my thought process to a whole new place. It&#8217;s when I realized that my love of organizing and my passion for mission-oriented work could be combined; Certified KonMari Consultants work with their clients to not just organize their homes, but to help them identify their ideal lifestyle and live into that vision fully! It was clear that the time had come for me to finally pursue professional organizing, and that’s how Get Organized Y’all® was born!</p>



<p>I attended Marie Kondo&#8217;s training in New York City in March 2019, and on June 21, 2019, I was honored to become Georgia’s first Certified KonMari Consultant. I am thrilled to be on this journey, and I would love for you to join me by <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/schedule/">scheduling a complimentary consultation</a> today!</p>
