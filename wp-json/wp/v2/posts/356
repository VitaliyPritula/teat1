My first organizing memory is from when I was a small child, maybe 6 or 7, growing up in rural south Georgia. I\u2019d read in a book that the protagonist had color-coded their closet, and I\u2019d JUST learned about Roy G. Biv in school. Needless to say, it was a messy endeavor as I was only just barely tall enough to reach my hangers, but kudos to my mom for letting me embrace my inner organizer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-amateur-hour\">Amateur Hour<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decades later, my clothing was still in rainbow order and I\u2019d graduated to sorting my bookshelves according to Library of Congress Call Number. It was 2014, and Marie Kondo&#8217;s <em><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2T4GOAP\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up<\/a><\/em> had just been published in the United States. A close friend who knew I was a pretty organized person asked me to help her organize her closet. She&#8217;d read Marie&#8217;s book, and was determined to get tidy. I read a couple of articles online, realized that I naturally organized in a way that was fairly consistent with Marie&#8217;s method, and decided to wing it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward a few years and I was beginning to run out of friends who would let me organize their homes in exchange for free pizza and wine. I&#8217;d recently discovered the world of &#8220;clean with me&#8221; videos on YouTube, and I&#8217;d stumbled down a rabbit hole of someone who was filming their entire KonMari process. Towards the end of her tidying marathon, she mentioned that she was planning to attend one of the first KonMari Consultant Certification seminars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-certification\">Certification<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Insert record scratch here.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certified KonMari Consultants? Now THAT sounded right up my alley. I&#8217;d toyed with the idea of pursing professional organizing as a side job, and to study with Marie sounded like a dream come true. I started researching all things KonMari and signed myself up for the next seminar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step towards becoming a Certified KonMari Consultant is to complete your own tidying marathon. Now, as someone who has always been pretty organized and who doesn&#8217;t like a lot of clutter, my house was already pretty neat and tidy. But what I didn&#8217;t realize is that I had done a really good job of organizing things that no longer sparked joy. I was quite surprised when I wound up donating three FULL carloads of things that were ready for a new home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew how to tidy my home on my own before, but it took the KonMari Method<b>\u00ae<\/b> to shift my thought process to a whole new place. It&#8217;s when I realized that my love of organizing and my passion for mission-oriented work could be combined; Certified KonMari Consultants work with their clients to not just organize their homes, but to help them identify their ideal lifestyle and live into that vision fully! It was clear that the time had come for me to finally pursue professional organizing, and that\u2019s how Get Organized Y\u2019all\u00ae was born!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I attended Marie Kondo&#8217;s training in New York City in March 2019, and on June 21, 2019, I was honored to become Georgia\u2019s first Certified KonMari Consultant. I am thrilled to be on this journey, and I would love for you to join me by <a href=\"https:\/\/getorganizedyall.com\/schedule\/\">scheduling a complimentary consultation<\/a> today!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My journey to becoming one of Marie Kondo&#8217;s KonMari Consultants started at a very young age.
