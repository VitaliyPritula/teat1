This isn&#8217;t an arbitrary starting point &#8211; there are actually very good reasons why we tackle this category first!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-do-we-start-with-clothing\">Why do we start with clothing? <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The somewhat glib answer is because clothing tends to be an easy category to start with. However, there&#8217;s a lot more to that statement than is obvious on the surface! We have a very intimate relationship with our clothing. It&#8217;s something that we are physically in contact with, so we have a visceral response to whether we like our clothing or not. We sense how it feels, how it fits, how it moves. Do I like this color? Do I like this style? Do I find it easy to launder? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this information comes to us almost immediately when we pick up a piece of clothing. We&#8217;ve got a lot of data to help us understand whether or not each clothing item sparks joy! And not only does this help us to sort our clothing &#8211; it also sets us up for success for the rest of our items too. By learning how to determine what sparks joy with an easier category, we&#8217;re practicing that discernment skill. This will allow us to approach future categories with more skill and intention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What&#8217;s the difference between &#8220;I wear it&#8221; and &#8220;it sparks joy&#8221;?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all of my clients immediately default into sorting their clothing into a few different sub-categories &#8211; things they wear a lot, things they don&#8217;t wear a lot, and things that they&#8217;re holding onto that don&#8217;t fit (no, it&#8217;s not just you, almost <em>all <\/em>of my clients have some version of this pile). But just because you regularly wear something doesn&#8217;t mean it sparks joy! Sometimes our best pieces are lost in a cluttered closet. Or we have so many clothes that we just grab what we can find, even if it&#8217;s not our favorite. By truly evaluating each piece we are able to intentionally decide if it sparks joy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A peek inside my closet!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone&#8217;s clothing is different, just like everyone&#8217;s physical space is different, so no two closets are ever going to be the same. That said, my clients often ask me about <em>my<\/em> closet, so here are a few of my favorite tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Color Coordination<\/strong>: It&#8217;s the trick that started me on my personal organizing journey &#8211; hanging my clothes in rainbow order, something I started doing in elementary school. For me, I immediately have a sense of order in my closet because the colors aren&#8217;t all jumbled together. I&#8217;m already less focused on clutter, and more focused on what clothing will best support my day.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Purses &amp; Bags<\/strong>: I used to store my purses in a big clear bin. It was neat and tidy, but a pain to pull out what I needed and wasn&#8217;t very attractive. I made some small adjustments using an inexpensive fabric bin and some acrylic bag hangers. Now I smile every time I enter my closet and see my purses on display!<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make it Personal<\/strong>: I&#8217;m very fortunate that my closet has a lot of extra space, so I&#8217;ve been able to add some fun non-clothing items as a little display that sparks joy for me. But even if you don&#8217;t have much space, you can still dress up this utilitarian space. Display a sentimental item, a colorful rug, or even just a mirror with a little personality!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The KonMari Method\u00ae has a specific order in which we declutter our items; the first category is always clothing.
