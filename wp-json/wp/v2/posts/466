Many people are tempted to skip this step (they&#8217;re excited to start pulling clothes out of the closet), but that would be a grave mistake. Your ideal vision is crucial to understanding how the things you own fit into your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-does-spark-joy-mean-to-you\">What does &#8220;spark joy&#8221; mean to you?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My first session with a new client always starts with a conversation. We&#8217;ve all heard the phrase &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/2DWZzEv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spark joy<\/a>,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not a one size fits all concept. This phrase is shorthand for something that fits into your ideal vision. It does not mean that you get super joyful with every item you own (we all have toothbrushes and bills that we need to keep). And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to start the process defining what &#8220;spark joy&#8221; means to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk with clients, the conversation almost always starts with what they&#8217;re looking for in their home. But that&#8217;s not where we stop. I want to know what you feel is holding you back, not just in your physical space, but in your life. Sometimes there are things that are challenging us that influence our spaces and the things we own, but we haven&#8217;t connected the dots yet to determine that. The KonMari Method<b>\u00ae<\/b> is a process that helps us identify and live out our ideal lifestyle &#8211; that has to start out with a clear idea of our vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This initial conversation is one of my favorite parts of working with clients! <a href=\"https:\/\/getorganizedyall.com\/ideal-lifestyle\/\">Check out some of the resources<\/a> that you can use to help you identify your ideal vision for your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sometimes-your-ideal-vision-will-change\">Sometimes your ideal vision will change!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I love seeing how my clients&#8217; visions become crystal clear throughout the tidying process. People who were uncertain in the beginning start to focus. People who thought they had a clear idea of their vision see that the things they own don&#8217;t support that, so either the items go or the vision changes (or, in many cases, both). And some people are able to confidently state that their vision from the beginning was exactly right, and they are thrilled to have a home and items that support that vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why it is SO important to start with exploring your ideal vision! Your ideal vision serves as the metric by which you can evaluate the things in your life. When I ask my client &#8220;does this spark joy?&#8221; what I am asking is if the item fits into the life they have said they want for themselves. This is not only helpful as you are going through the actual tidying process, but it serves as a jumping-off point for your life post-tidying as well. Clients have started new hobbies, developed different relationships, changed jobs &#8211; all because they have so clearly defined what they&#8217;re looking for in their lives!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in learning more about how I can help you identify your ideal vision for your life? <a href=\"https:\/\/getorganizedyall.com\/schedule\/\">Schedule a complimentary phone consultation<\/a> today!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Organizing according to the KonMari Method\u00ae always begins by defining your ideal vision.
