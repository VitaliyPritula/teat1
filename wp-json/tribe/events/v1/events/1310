Decluttering is often more than sorting objects, it\u2019s about emotions too. We\u2019ll be joined by Lindsey Hardegree, Certified KonMari Consultant, to learn how to take the first steps.<\/p>\n<p>About <em>Love and Stuff<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;How do you live without your mother?&#8221; Filmmaker Judith Helfand asks this unbearable question twice: once as a daughter caring for her terminally ill mother, and again as an &#8220;old new mom&#8221; single-parenting her much-longed-for adopted baby girl. With footage from 25 years of first-person filmmaking, shiva babka, and 63 boxes of dead parents&#8217; &#8220;stuff,&#8221; the film asks: What do we really need to leave our children? <em>Love &amp; Stuff<\/em> is a nonlinear documentary that follows Helfand as she cares for her dying mother and sorts through the emotional and literal &#8220;stuff&#8221; left behind. The film invites thoughtful examination of parenting and caregiving, end-of-life care, grief and loss, the difficulty of letting go, and the deep and abiding love that goes on beyond death.<\/p>\n<p>Interested in booking Lindsey for a workshop or event? <a href=\"https:\/\/getorganizedyall.com\/book-lindsey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Let&#8217;s
