										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I have received the COVID-19 vaccine and all additional boosters available as of October 2024. I am no longer requiring clients to electronically sign a COVID-19 Liability Waiver prior to each in-person appointment, but I ask that you be mindful of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current CDC COVID-19 guidelines</a>.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I no longer require masks during sessions. However, on weeks when I have multiple in-person meetings, I may still wear a mask for in-person appointments as a precaution.</li>



<li>If you are unwell or have been exposed to COVID-19, you must notify me immediately to postpone your appointment – cancellation fees will be waived for those needing to cancel/reschedule due to COVID-19 with at least 2 hours&#8217; notice (more advanced notice is appreciated and welcome). Cancellations with less than 2 hours&#8217; notice will be subject to our standard <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/ufaqs/what-is-your-cancellation-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation policy</a>.</li>



<li>I will use the same good judgment that I ask of my clients, and should I be exposed or feel unwell I will give you as much notice as possible. If I need to cancel due to COVID-19 exposure or symptoms, your appointment will be rescheduled for a later date.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding my COVID-19 policy, please <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact me</a> prior to <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduling an appointment</a>!</p>

<p>Most of my services are offered virtually via Zoom: whether you&#8217;re looking for KonMari Method® organizing, productivity consulting, or budget coaching, I am happy to work with you wherever you&#8217;re located!</p>



<p>For all virtual sessions, I <em>highly recommend</em> you install Zoom on your device prior to our session so that we won&#8217;t use our time together on technical troubleshooting!</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>If your session is for <strong>productivity consulting</strong> or <strong>budget coaching</strong>, I recommend you use your computer (desktop or laptop) &#8211; we often need to utilize the screen-sharing feature to look at your documents, calendar, budget, etc. and this is much easier to accomplish on a computer than on a phone or tablet.</li><li>If your session is for <strong>organizing</strong>, usually a phone/tablet/laptop (something portable) is most helpful &#8211; you&#8217;ll be &#8220;carrying me&#8221; all over your house to show me things!</li><li>For more information about Zoom, including instructions on how to install on various devices, please visit <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://zoom.us/</a>.</li></ul>



<p>If you have further questions about the logistics of working together virtually, please schedule your complimentary consultation <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/schedule/">here</a> and I&#8217;m happy to answer your questions!</p>

<p>As Marie Kondo says, &#8220;we can only
transform our lives if we sincerely want to.&#8221; We cannot make these changes
for someone who is not interested in changing, so if your intention is to purchase
my services as a way to organize a reluctant person, then we will not see
success.</p>



<p>However, if you know of someone who would like to go through the process of decluttering and organizing, then <a href="https://getorganizedyall.com/gift-certificates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a gift certificate for my services</a> is a lovely and thoughtful way to show your support!</p>

<p>Decluttering is an intimate and deeply personal process. Ideally I’ll work with each member of the household individually (including children!) to make decisions regarding their things. </p>



<p>If there is someone who is truly not on board, we can respectfully avoid their spaces and belongings. However, once one person in the household declutters and organizes, it is very common that others sense the newfound joy and peace that this process brings and they’ll want in on it too! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It may not seem like the obvious place to begin (or you may feel that you don’t need to go through your clothes) but trust me – this is truly the best starting point. One of the key principles of the KonMari Method<strong>®</strong> is sharpening your ability to discern which items you truly want to keep (what “sparks joy”) as opposed to focusing on which things you want to get rid of. This takes a bit of practice, and decluttering clothing is one of the simplest, most clear ways to start that honing process. Plus, since it’s often a relatively easy category to sort through, we&#8217;ll start off with a big sense of accomplishment, bringing us the energy to continue on to harder categories! </p>

<p>The first thing we will do is reflect on why your are interested in beginning this journey, what your vision for your ideal lifestyle might look like, and <a aria-label="what &quot;spark joy&quot; means to you personally (opens in a new tab)" href="https://getorganizedyall.com/ideal-lifestyle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what &#8220;spark joy&#8221; means to you personally</a>. This may be the first time you&#8217;ve ever considered these questions, but do not worry &#8211; the beauty of the KonMari Method<strong>®</strong> is that it adapts to meet you where you are!</p>



<p>Then we&#8217;ll do a thorough walk-through of your home (20-30 minutes); this step is key, even if we&#8217;re working together virtually. It&#8217;s important for me to get a full understanding of your goals and challenges, and to learn more about what your vision for your life and your space looks like. </p>



<p>At that point, we will begin our first decluttering session! In accordance with the KonMari Method<strong>®</strong>, we will begin with clothes, so I do request you<strong> do your laundry before our first session</strong> (no need to put clean clothes away – we’re going to pull it all out anyway!). </p>
